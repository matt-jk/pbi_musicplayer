# pbi_musicplayer
Custom visual for the Power BI platform that can play a serialized mp3 file. This is an exploration of using Power BI to understand audio concepts. The link to see this visual is posted in the MS gallery: https://community.powerbi.com/t5/Data-Stories-Gallery/Understanding-Audio-Concepts/m-p/704891

There are two folders:

* musicplayer - The source code for making the custom visual, created by the pbiviz utility and then modified
* serialize_files - a Python script for serializing the music mp3 files you want to store into a format to be inserted in PBI tables
